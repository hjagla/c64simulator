Here is the Visual Basic 2010 source code. I chose Visual Basic as it is simple language and speed was not my concern. Anyone with some programming knowledge could look at it and hopefully understand what is going on. Basic was the first programming language I started on with all of my computers. It is easy and understandable.

On a side note, the code is far from perfect. There are bugs, the SID chip is NOT simulated, CIA chips are simulated and I did the best I could understanding how they work from the datasheet I found online, the VIC chip is far from perfect and does just enough to display the startup screen. There is NO keyboard input.

Feel free to modify the code, make improvements, fix bugs, clean up the code. All I ask is that if you share it, give credit where credit is due and share the source code.
